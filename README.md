# SortingAlgorithms

#Small project implementing the following algorithms:
#a. Insertion Sort
#b. Mergesort
#c. Quicksort1 (Regular Quicksort)
#d. Quicksort2 (Quicksort / Insertion Sort Combo)
#e. Quicksort3 (Randomized Quicksort)
#Tests are carried out on arrays of size n=2, 4, 8 to 2^16, and included are Word documents showing the resulting data and graph computation times in nanoseconds.
